<h1 align = "center">Ransomeware Detection and Analysis in an Encrypted Network</h1>

<br>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>With the growing number of Internet users, the scope of ransomware attacks is also increasing. The cybercrime magazine, Cybersecurity Ventures, predicted that ransomware damages could reach $20 billion by 2021. The healthcare and financial service industries are among the hardest hit.
<br>
The purpose of this project is to address this gap by developing a machine learning model that involves a diversified feature set that combines the unique characteristics of ransomware and encrypted network connections.
